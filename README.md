# Donald-vs-CRISPR
This project is my second data analysis project.

As a molecular biologist and American, I was curious what our country really thought about one of the most popular genetic editing tools known to science - CRISPR. Of course its hard to know just how popular something is without something to compare it to, so I decided to compare it to our lovely president, Mr. Donald J Trump.

Being a molecular biologist, we are taught to use controls, both positive and negative in our experiments - so I opted to use tweets mentioning JOHN CENA as my positive control. Why? Because everybody loves John Cena of course.

The basic setup is;

    1. Gather Twitter data (filter for data points I think are pertinent to sentiment with a few others that might show interesting insights).
    2. Parse that data for each Twitter stream.
    3. Compare my three subjects to one another.

As you'll notice I have posted a Whiteboard Plan image, a few days back I brainstormed some interesting analyses I could do with my data. If you wish to gather your own data and analyze it, you can use these whiteboard ideas as your own!

I am hosting all of the raw data I have gathered on my computer, so all that will be publicly available is the scripts that I used to gather, parse and analyze the data. If you would like my raw data, you can email me

I'll post my finished Figures in the "Figures" folder.

Cheers!
